# Mid-Course-Assessment---ML-Case-Study
Mid Course Assessment - ML Case Study(Credit Scoring (Banking &amp; Financial Services))


This project aims to develop a machine learning-based credit scoring system for a financial institution to classify customers into three credit risk categories: Good, Poor, or Standard. By leveraging historical financial behavior, loan history, and demographic data, the solution seeks to replace traditional, error-prone methods with a dynamic, interpretable model that improves risk assessment accuracy, reduces defaults, and enables personalized financial services.
